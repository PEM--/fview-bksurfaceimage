# BkImage
A plugin for [famous-views](http://famous-views.meteor.com).

This plugin brings [famous-bksurfaceimage](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-bkimagesurface) in Blaze or Jade templating for [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com).

As the author of the component says it:
> BkImageSurface adds support for sizing strategies such as AspectFit and AspectFill for displaying images with [famo.us](http://famo.us). It uses a `div` with a background-image rather than a `img` tag.
